# All-Queues-Implementation-in-Python

1. Implement Queue [FIFO] using LinkedList. It should have following functionalities:
- Enqueue (add an element)
- Dequeue (remove an element)
- isEmpty (check whether queue is empty or not)
- size (to print number of elements present in the queue)
- printQueue (to print all the elements of the Queue)

2. Implement Circular Queue using Linked List. It should have following functionalities:
- Enqueue (add an element)
- Dequeue (remove an element)
- isEmpty (check whether queue is empty or not)
- Size (to print number of elements present in the queue)
- Display (to print all the elements of the Queue)
- Search (to search if an element exists in the Queue or not with the given value)

3. Implement Priority Queue using Linked List. It should have following functionalities:
- Enqueue (add an element)
- Dequeue (remove an element)
- isEmpty (check whether queue is empty or not)
- Size (to print number of elements present in the queue)
- Display (to print all the elements of the Queue)
- Search (to search if an element exists in the Queue or not with the given 
value)
